## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **HTML Structure:**  
   The clock face is built using basic HTML elements like `div` for the clock container and the hands.

2. **CSS Styling:**  
   CSS is used to:
   - Create a circular clock face.
   - Style the hour, minute, and second hands with precise alignment.
   - Position the hands dynamically around the clock face.

3. **JavaScript Logic:**  
   - Fetches the current system time using `Date` object.
   - Calculates the degree of rotation for each hand (hour, minute, second).
   - Applies the rotation using CSS transforms.
